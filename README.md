# Http server

Trying to implement the [RFC2068](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2068) outlining how an http 1.1 server needs to behave, all written in Rust.

## WARNING

- This is mostly for me to practice my Rust skilss, so the code may be shit and probably will be, unless I decide I want to refactor.

- While I don't want it to be absolutely slow, I don't think I'll be bothering myself with squeezing out every bit of performance imaginable, as this is not the goal of my project.

- This is a WIP project, not everything is implemented.
